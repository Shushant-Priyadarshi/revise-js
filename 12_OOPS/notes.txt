🎯OOPS

    👉 Js is not a oops language, due to its prototype nature,
    but ES6 introduced the concept of oops in the language in 2015.
    But still it is not, it only provides a syntactical sugar.

    ➡️ Object: collection of properties and methods.
    ➡️ new(constructor function): new keyword helps to make multiple instances of objects.
