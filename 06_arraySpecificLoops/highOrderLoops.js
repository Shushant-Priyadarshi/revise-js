//  High-order array loops in JavaScript refer to array methods that
//  accept a function as an argument (a callback function) and 
//  iterate over the array to perform specific tasks. These methods 
//  are considered higher-order because they operate on arrays and
//  take other functions as arguments.

//1) forEach => one.js
